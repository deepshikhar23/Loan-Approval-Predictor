# Loan Status Predictor
This repository contains a Loan Status Predictor model trained using the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. The model is designed to classify the eligibility for a loan status based on given features.

## Overview
The Loan Status Predictor is built using machine learning techniques and the Random Forest Classifier algorithm. It takes various features related to a loan application as input and predicts whether the loan status will be approved or not. The model is trained on a labeled dataset and achieves high accuracy in predicting loan statuses.

## Files
The repository includes the following files:

loan_prediction.ipynb: Jupyter Notebook file that contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It provides a step-by-step guide to reproduce the model and analyze the results.

loan_status_prediction.csv: Comma-separated values (CSV) file containing the labeled dataset used for training and evaluation. The dataset includes various features such as income, credit score, employment status, and loan status. You can use your own labeled dataset or explore public datasets related to loan approvals for training and evaluation.

random_forest_classifier.pkl: Pickle file that contains the trained random forest model. This model can be loaded and used to make predictions on new loan applications. Refer to the Jupyter Notebook for an example of how to load and use this model.

## Usage
To use the Loan Status Predictor, follow these steps:

Clone the repository to your local machine.

Open and run the jupyter_notebook.ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab. This notebook contains the code for data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. It provides detailed explanations and code snippets to guide you through each step of the process.

If you want to make predictions on new loan applications using the trained model, you can load the random_forest_classifier.pkl file in your Python script or notebook. Refer to the Jupyter Notebook for an example of how to load and use this file.

Feel free to explore and experiment with the code in the Jupyter Notebook to customize the model, try different algorithms, or incorporate additional features for improved performance.

## Disclaimer
Please note that the dataset provided in this repository is a sample dataset and may not reflect real-world loan application data. The purpose of sharing this repository is to demonstrate the implementation of the Loan Status Predictor model. It is important to use reliable and accurate datasets when working with loan-related applications.
